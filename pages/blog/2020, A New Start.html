            It's the last day of January 2020 and the past month has been full of events and emotions.
        </p>
        <p>I just turned 21 a few days ago. I never realized how time passes so fast that I'm now at the one fourth mark of my life, assuming I live to 80 (a little over the average life expectancy posted by the UN). However, this is not totally my fault, since my first ten years of life is nothing but a blur dotted with sporadic memories. The second conscious ten years of my life was mainly spent on homework and games. I never developed any interests in any sports, probably because my dad is so good at any of them that I childishly thought he only taught me basketball to make me feel bad. In comparison, I was much better at my schoolwork (totally as a side note, my dad was not a good student at school). I always strived for the best though never truly became one, but through all those years of studying for a better grade, I've learned how to effectively approach a new concept, be it a new programming language, an unfamiliar coursework or a new skill. This method of learning stuff proves useful till now and I'm grateful for it.</p>
        <p>Enough of the past, let's talk about the present. 2020 marks the start of a new decade full of possibilities. I'm in my third year of college and am currently preparing for the GRE test for my graduate schools. As a hard-working student, I'm doing OK with my coursework. However, I start to feel agitated recently. The cause, as I said earlier, is that I'm feeling the quickening steps of time.</p>
        <p>For too long, I've been stuck in my comfort zone. I'm afraid of going out to the world and explore other fascinating things in life. To justify my cowardice, I've made up many excuses that prove to myself that I don't have the time, skill or money to pursue things outside my bubble. Although, objectively speaking, none of the reasons are true. I'm just too afraid to make the first step. Now I'm 21, with all my youthful strength and strong curiosity that quickly fade away, if I don't take advantage of them and explore what the world has to offer now, I'll lose my golden time to attempt new things and regret it for the rest of my life.</p>
        <p>More importantly, life is unpredictable and sometimes it can hit people hard and cold without any forewarning. Two months earlier (Dec. 2019), a new type of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak' targe='_blank'>Crono virus</a> was detected in Wuhan, China. Within months, the virus has spread across China and was discovered in other countries as well, including <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/26california-coronavirus.html' target='_blank'>the U.S.</a>. More than ten thousand people in China have been infected by now and hundreds of lives has been taken. My hometown, Zhengzhou, is no exception in this outbreak. I'm deeply worried about my families and friends at this time, yet I can do nothing but watch the situation intently with them, and prey for my country and those who are affected around the world. In great disasters like this, it seems that the distance between life and death is thin as air. No one can predict the future and the only thing people can do is to make every minute of their lives count.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I have decided to make a change from now on. Making a blog for my website is the first thing on my todo list. I have been thinking about it for far too long, and now I feel relieved that I've made the first step. I truly hope I can follow the words I say today, and this blog can serve as a reminder for it.</p>
