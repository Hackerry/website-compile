            Several years ago, I would never imagine myself in the world of computer science. Now I want to look back at things that contribute to or influenced me pursuing this field of study. I summarized them into several stages, with each bringing new insights and guides me deeper into this facinatning world of computing.
        </p>

        <h2>Computers</h2>
        <p>
            My jouney started with learning how to use a computer. When I was little, our family had an old-style desktop with a heavy CRT monitor. My parents are by no means tech-savvy and they only used it for sending emails and browsing the web. They never let me touch it until I was in elementary school, and they strictly limited my computer time to one hour per day, afarid that I would get addicted to computer. Back then I played video games, did "internet surfing" and chat with my friends online.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I was lucky to have some early experieces working with softwares like Flash and Photoshop, using a computer magazine my mom bought me as guidance. According to her, I was very intrigued by those cool tricks introduced in that magazine, and I often bothered her with images or videos I had made to earn some praise. She believes that my interest in computers was brought up by that magazine. Indeed, I had my first glimpse of the unlimited power of computers at that time, thanks to that book.

        <h2>Hackers</h2>
        <p>
            No matter how I don't want to admit it, but I have to say there's some unpleasant incident that contributes a lot to my early enthusiasm for computers. It happened when I was about 8/9 years old. One day I was suddenly unable to log into my social media account after getting home from school. Desperate as I was after trying the same password again and again, I called my mom. She followed the recovery steps to reset my password while I waited agitated on the side. Luckily, she had helped me register my account and had set a recovery phone number for me. Several minutes later I was able to login with the new password she gave me, but just as I clicked into my homepage, I saw numerous 18+ photos posted under my account. Shocked and not fully realizing what I was seeing, I was ordered to go to my room by my mother, while she deleted those posts for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can still remember how furiated I was back then. I felt violated. After all, it was my account with my nickname that had those photos, and all my "little secret posts" were probably open to whoever stole my account, although I was sure they didn't bother looking over them. I ruminated for days how the "bad guys" managed to have my password. I even wrote an angry post addressed to them for stealing a kid's account. Despite all my anger, I managed to comfort myself by looking through online articles about how other people had had similar experiences. After reading through some posts from people sharing their own bad experiences, I was surprised to find several special posts talking about stealing people's passwords for a price.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was simply mind-blowing to me at that time. So, the Internet was not a happy free land once I thought it was, and there were people trying to pry on others' secrets on the internet! I suddenly had so many questions that I couldn't answer. Why would anybody want to steal others' password? How would they feel if their password gets stolen? And of course, how did they do it? That's when I first saw the word - "programming". I thought it had to be something mystery and powerful, otherwise how could they procure my password without me noticing? For a split second I wanted to dig a hole into the matter, not because I wanted to steal others' password as a revenge, but out of curiosity and the logical thinking that if I knew how they did it, I could prevent them from stealing my password again! However, I was simply not equipped with the right knowledge to understand what those posts were talking about. What I did get out of this incident was the desire to know more about computers in general, and to use those knowledges to protect myself and others from those unpleasant things from happening.
        </p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
            In the follwoing six to seven years, I didn't take any special interests in computers like I once had as a child. Part of the reason was that I attended a bording high school without computer/phone/any electronic access. The more intrinsic reason was that I didn't know where to start. I don't believe there were many good resources online about programming back then, or I was simply too dumb not knowing where to find them. Time came to 2015 (thanks to my mom for reminding me the year). I vaguely remembered it was a weekend and we were at a family dinner. Out of nowhere I heard one of my relatives talked about the computing industry and that his job was to do programming. I can't remember what I was thinking then and there, but the next thing I knew, I was asking him how I can learn programming. He so kindly gave me the suggestion to learn Java as my first language and said I could start with the book <i>Thinking In Java</i> by Bruce Eckel. My path to CS officially began.
        </p>
        <p>
            I followed his suggestion and bought the book. It was a really heavy one with several hundred pages and I went right into coding the next day I had it. I naively thought I could learn all about programming in this one book. Although that thinking was obviously incorrect and later proved to cause me a lot of frustrations, I'm honestly thankful to my naive thinking as it motivated me to really dig into the book and establish a pretty solid fundation in Java. So, you probably know what happened next: my first "Hello World" program, my first encounter with polymorphism, then into deeper concepts like concurrency and generics. In fact, I never really finished that book because the deeper concepts, which are core to computer science, were too hard for me to grasp at that time. So instead of struggling over them anymore, I shoved that book onto the shelf, believing that I was ready to take on real world chanllenges - like a Kung Fu master stepping out of his dojo to see the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Hunt for Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
            I quickly realized I was wrong in thinking that I knew almost everything about programming after I finished the book. I was headless, greedy and impatient during this stage. I first wanted to learn how to make a website, so I impulsively bought a book on Apache webserver development and started cracking on it. I made some interactive websites following the tutorials in the book and was proud about myself initially. Then soon the material became harder to understand and, to make things worse, I came to realize that the technology was too old for modern web development and there were already frameworks that were easier to work with. So, I gave it up after mid-way through that book.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I learnt HTML/CSS/JS, Python and C in the same learn-and-give-up fashion. I only tapped into the basics and then quickly deemed it enough to move on. In hindsight, I was probably shocked that there was so much more that I didn't know about and I wanted to conver that up by learning a little bit of everything. Also, I was kind of let down by the fact that I spent so much time studing (almost) that whole book on Java yet I couldn't make anything cool and "useful". By "useful" I meant, at that time, industrial level softwares that take a whole company several years to develop! Yeah. I was arrogant and this state of mind went on for quite a long time even into my first year of college. I so wanted to prove to myself, more than to others, that I knew stuff and my time spent on learning wasn't wasted.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this stage, I worked with many programming languages and learnt various unrelated things in general about computers and programming. For example, I had my introduction to hardware and computer architecture from a random book, learnt about some computer security issues by doing CTF challenges, learnt some basics on GUI game design, and even tried Unity for making 3D games. Although I never really dig deep into those fields, they satisfied my desire to learn more (by no means understand) about computer related topics. In a way, they introduced me to all the various branches of computer science that I may be interested in, and allowed me to dabble in those fields before finding things I was really interested in. So, I guess despite all the less fruitful learnings, I did get something out of this headless hunt for knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>
            I don't remember who said this to me, probably one of my professor or my friend, but that they say the most prominent difference between a regular programmer, who only knows how to program (like me six years ago) and a computer scientist is that one only knows things work while the other knows why things work. In other words, computer scientists not only focus on the practical aspect of things but also the innerworkings of them. I wouldn't regard this statement too much even two years before, but I gradually come to realize the trueness in it and the implication that I should be aware of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing how things work in any topics of computer science requires a well-rounded view, and it means sometimes reaching to the deepest level as I can go. Take the Operating System class I'm currently taking as an example. To understand how concurrency works, I must know about operating systems and how time-sharing is achieved, know about computer architecture and how threads are laid out in memory, and even know about how hardware intelligently facilitates more efficient concurrency in multi-core CPUs. These understandings are crucial foundations for knowing what's behind the simple statement <icode>Thread workerThread = new Thread(...)</icode>. No wonder why I didn't understand those deeper concepts several years ago - I was simply not ready yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it seems that in order to excel in computer science, I must be prepared and open to constantly learning new things and digging into fields that I may not be familiar with. But that's ok as I'm preparing for the really important things yet to come. It's like a video game where I level up each time I understand more of something, and by doing so, I can unlock more adavanced weapons and tools that can help me greatly in the final boss fight (Yes, I'm talking about Minecraft here). Now I adopted this "constant learning" mindset, it proved more reassuring than my old thinking. I'm no longer afraid of finding holes in my knowledge set because that's how it should and always will be. Admiting to it and working on it is the only way to get rid of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            More importantly, how fascinating it is to know that I can never learn enough of something. It's like a fun game that never ends. There are always ideas to explore, things to try out. I can merrily march my way forward without fear of sudden ending.
        </p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
            I'm writing those reviews of my past events from my current mindset and I believe they will differ some years from now. Hope I like CS anytime when I looked back at this post as I like it right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stay Safe and be happy!
